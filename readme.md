While i like (at least i think) the idea of rust

i really want a proper compiled OOP language

i don't like C++ header files and Javascripts

sloopyness, i want something that feels good

to write in that feels like home (C++) without

all the draw backs with ability to still laverage

C/C++ libraries


Roadmap

- [ ] figure out what makes rust special
- [ ] make specification
- [ ] write interpreter
- [ ] write compiler
- [ ] make the language self-hosted

Sidequests

- [ ] get a logo
- [ ] write vscode languege server

i know it might take time to get usable but when

it's done, i'll finally be able to use "modern"

programming language with comfort


i really want this language to feel good it's a Dream
