for myself to enjoy coding again

some mockups of the language can be found in ```.dm``` files

i used to love coding but now i feel burned out

and i can't see any way do help myself

've already taken long enough break from coding

i really want this language to feel good it's a Dream

## this language isn't about memory safety

it's more about enjoying the process of coding
